RAMP APPLICATION - HEAD OF CUSTOMER SUCCESS
Activation & Onboarding
Katie Kelly

================================================================================
QUESTION 1: Walk us through the structure of the Customer Success or Implementation organization you led most recently.
================================================================================

What customer segments did your teams support? How many people and management layers did you oversee? What were the key challenges you faced as the organization scaled, and how did you address them?


ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE

As SVP Client & Platform Operations at iCapital, I built a 25+ person, multi-manager CS organization from scratch in 12 months, structured around specialized teams with two management layers. I also stepped into a 50+ person global implementation team where I implemented the operating model and managed the mid-market and SMB expansion, specifically increasing efficiency by 60%, more output with fewer resources.


CLIENT SEGMENTS WE SUPPORTED

• Scaled: High-volume segment requiring efficient, standardized processes (High Volume, Low Touch, Lower Revenue)

• Mid-Market: Clients needing customized onboarding with tailored support (Mid Volume, Mid-Touch, High Revenue Potential)

• Enterprise: High-complexity clients requiring bespoke implementations and dedicated account management (Low Volume, High Touch, High Revenue)


TEAM STRUCTURE & MANAGEMENT LAYERS

I organized the division into three specialized functions to eliminate the inefficiencies of commingled roles:

1. Implementation Team (Managers + Associates): Focused exclusively on client rollout, platform configuration, and onboarding - handling 100+ white label implementations annually

2. Operations Team (Account Managers + Player Coaches + Associates): Managed recurring business activities and onboarding (500+ onboardings annually), ensuring consistent delivery and client alignment

3. Support Team (Front-end/Back-end Managers + Associates): Bifurcated support handling 25,000+ annual tickets, with front-end managing platform issues and back-end handling data integrity

This created 2-3 management layers depending on client tier, with clear coverage ratios.


KEY SCALING CHALLENGES & SOLUTIONS

Challenge 1: Doing More with Less During Hypergrowth

While I had dotted-line oversight of a Mid-Market/SMB segment earlier in my tenure, that team faced a 25% workforce reduction while output demands increased 20%.

Solution: I developed and implemented a 5-Part Operational Framework that improved efficiency by 60% (productivity per employee from 400 to 600 hours annually). This framework became the blueprint for scaling the broader organization.


Challenge 2: Inconsistent Service Quality Across Tiers

Risk of enterprise clients receiving SMB-level service or vice versa.

Solution: Built rigorous client segmentation with tier-specific playbooks, coverage ratios, and SLAs. Created role-task matrices ensuring each deliverable had clear owners and time allocations.


Challenge 3: Knowledge Silos & Training Inefficiency

Traditional 3-6 month ramp time was unsustainable during rapid growth.

Solution: Invested heavily in documentation and training infrastructure (videos, how-to guides, checklists for each deliverable), reducing onboarding to 3-4 weeks while improving quality and eliminating client-facing training costs.


Challenge 4: Resource Allocation & Pipeline Visibility

Difficulty balancing workloads across 500+ new annual onboardings.

Solution: Established global pipeline management with clear staffing and management models tied to client tiers, maintaining flexibility to reallocate resources based on demand while ensuring broader client assignments remain intact.


================================================================================
QUESTION 2: Give an example of how you've used data or tooling to improve onboarding efficiency or drive higher product adoption.
================================================================================

How did you connect these improvements to measurable business outcomes?


MY PHILOSOPHY

The systems and reporting infrastructure are what drive success, from there you need to measure what matter so the data tells you more than you knew before. At iCapital, I built a data-driven operational framework that fundamentally changed how we measured and improved performance.


THE SYSTEM I BUILT

Rather than implementing flashy software, I created an interconnected measurement system across five operational dimensions:

1. Process Mapping Data: Task-level time tracking, dependency mapping, and deliverable decomposition

2. Team Structure Metrics: Role-task assignment matrices and accountability tracking

3. Education Performance: Training completion rates and time-to-productivity

4. Resource Allocation: Pipeline forecasting and coverage ratio management

5. Performance Analytics: Efficiency ratios, output metrics, and trend analysis


THE EVOLUTION - EXCEL TO TABLEAU

Phase 1 (Excel-based):

Built comprehensive tracking spreadsheets that captured task-level hours and dependencies for each deliverable type, individual and team production hours mapped to client tiers, weekly pipeline status (implementations, onboardings, support tickets), and employee utilization and efficiency ratios.

Phase 2 (Tableau Dashboards):

As data volume scaled, I led the migration to Tableau, creating executive dashboards that provided real-time visibility into team efficiency trends, bottleneck identification across the delivery pipeline, client tier performance and resource allocation optimization, and quality metrics.


MEASURABLE BUSINESS OUTCOMES

The reporting infrastructure enabled data-driven decisions that delivered:

• +60% Productivity per Employee (394 → 629 hours)
• +50% Onboarding Throughput (250 → 500+ annually)
• -75% Ramp Time (3-6 months → 3-4 weeks)


THE KEY INSIGHT

By making operational data visible and actionable, we could pinpoint exactly where inefficiencies existed, whether in task allocation, training gaps, or resource imbalances and then systematically rather than anecdotally. This transformed us from reactive firefighting to proactive optimization.


================================================================================
QUESTION 3: Describe a time when you built or redefined collaboration between Customer Success and other GTM teams (e.g., Sales, Product, Finance).
================================================================================

$500K RECURRING OVERHEAD REDUCTION THROUGH CROSS-FUNCTIONAL LEADERSHIP

One of my most impactful cross-functional initiatives involved a strategic client who was facing $500,000 in annual recurring overhead costs for fund administration - costs that were threatening the client relationship and creating pricing pressure for our Sales team.


THE CHALLENGE

• Sales had a retention risk: The client was evaluating competitors due to cost concerns and ability to advance technology

• Product had built automation capabilities but they weren't being leveraged for this use case

• Implementation (my team) was managing the ongoing roadmap for the client's future with the company

• Prior leadership though the end-to-end solution wasn't feasible


MY ROLE: CLIENT-FACING LEADER & CROSS-FUNCTIONAL ORCHESTRATOR

Step 1: Took Ownership & Built the Business Case

• I told the client directly: "We are making this a top priority to solve this" creating a commitment to build trust with the client

• Worked with Sales to understand the retention risk and competitive dynamics

• Quantified the operational costs we could eliminate through automation


Step 2: Scoped the Solution with Product

• Collaborated with Product team to assess automation feasibility for this specific fund structure

• Identified gaps between existing capabilities and client requirements

• Co-developed implementation roadmap with clear milestones


Step 3: Coordinated the 4-Month Delivery

• Assembled cross-functional working team (Sales, Product, Implementation, Operations)

• Established weekly check-ins with clear ownership and accountability

• Led client communications, managing expectations while maintaining confidence

• Oversaw the technical implementation and client training on new automated workflows


Step 4: Executed & Measured

• Delivered on time in 4 months

• Transitioned fund administration to automated product

• Validated $500K in annual savings


BROADER IMPACT ON GTM COLLABORATION

This success case became a template for how I redefined collaboration:

With Sales:
Established formal handoff process between Sales, Product, and Implementation with clear acceptance criteria. Created feedback loop where my team provided product adoption insights to inform Sales strategy.

With Product:
Built regular cadence between Operations and Product teams for real-time client insights. My team became Product's "voice of customer" surfacing feature requests backed by business impact. Created escalation protocols where critical client needs got fast-tracked to Product roadmap discussions.

With Finance:
Collaborated on resource allocation models tied to client profitability. Provided operational metrics that informed pricing strategy. Built business cases for efficiency investments (training, tools, automation) with clear ROI.


THE RESULT

This wasn't a one-time win, it established a repeatable model for cross-functional problem-solving that made GTM teams more effective and created competitive differentiation in how we served enterprise clients.
