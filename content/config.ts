Most leaders inherit a function - I build organizations.\n\nI build the post-sales systems and operating mechanisms that drive enterprise retention, expansion, and product adoption across multi-sided platforms.\n\nMy operating philosophy: customer-centric, real-time feedback loops, cross-functional awareness, and treating customer outcomes as the ultimate measure of success. I build the teams, systems, and frameworks that make this mindset operational.",
